P.O.O.P Final Project

# Initial Commits:
From the repo I forked, this was only partially functional. It required both pip module installations & a vosk model to be added to the repo

Additionally, it only was able to listen 'using the vosk model' and return whatever speech it was given

# Required Installations
**NOTE: YOU MUST USE THE COMMAND *python -m pip install <-python module->***
 - sounddevice
 - vosk
 - pyttsx3
